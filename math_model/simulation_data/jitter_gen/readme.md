# Jitter Measurement Simulation Data

This folder contains accumulated phase simulation data.

## File Naming

The filename consists of the following parts, separated by the `_` character:
- **ac-mi**: Minimal accumulation time simulated [s].
- **ac-ma**: Maximal accumulation time simulated [s].
- **ac-nb**: Number of repetitions.
- **fn**: Nominal oscillation frequency [Hz].
- **fl**: Lower frequency bound [Hz].
- **fh**: Upper frequency bound [Hz].
- **hs**: Noise magnitudes tested.
- **nts**: Noise types tested.
